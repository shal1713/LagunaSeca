    <p>V6 Engine
With an available 4.0-liter engine packing 281 lb-ft of torque, the powerful V6 will get the job done. It has serious off-roading capabilities, and with a 6,710-lb maximum towing [*] capacity, Frontier’s got the muscle you need for work—or play. [*]
Go for the Desert Runner®, and get a powerful V6, a 5-speed automatic, and a whole lot of attitude. Equipped with Bilstein® off-road performance shocks, and mud and snow-rated all-terrain tires on 16” 6-spoke alloy wheels, this Frontier not only looks the part—it acts it. [*]</p>
